# Football Analysis
The project employs YOLOv5 to detect objects. It also measures the camera's movement as well as the players' speed and distance covered in the video.
## Model
Please run the Jupyter Notebook in the training folder to get the best model and put it into the model folder.
## Function
- YOLO: AI object detection model
- Kmeans: Pixel segmentation and clustering to detect t-shirt color
- Optical Flow: Measure camera movement
- Perspective Transformation: Represent scene depth and perspective
- Speed and distance calculation per player
